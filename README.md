PROJECT: Pro Audio Mixer Interface for VoiceMeeter

CURRENT STATUS:
- Built a complete, professional audio mixer UI that controls VoiceMeeter's audio engine (React/TailwindCSS).
- UI is functional with most interactions working (console.log shows where API calls go).
- Design is modern, dark-themed, hardware-inspired with real studio aesthetics.
- Segmented LED visualizers per channel.
- Redesigned, more horizontal mini-channels for collapsed sections.
- Implemented Drag-and-Drop for:
    - Reordering the main Input and Output sections themselves.
- **Removed Drag-and-Drop for individual channels (reordering within section / moving between sections).**
- Corrected inter-section separator line logic.
- Added "Add New Input Channel" and "Add New Output Channel" options to the settings menu.
- Implemented inline channel renaming via double-click and a 3-dot channel context menu.
- The 3-dot channel context menu also includes a "Select Input/Output Device" option (currently logs to console).
- **Actively debugging and refining:**
    - **Channel context menu positioning to ensure it appears directly under the 3-dot icon.**
    - **Slider (Volume/Monitor) and EQ Knob interaction to prevent accidental channel dragging (though channel drag is now removed, the underlying interaction fix is important).**
- This is an HTML/JS/React DEMO - Final implementation will be C# .NET with WPF/WinUI.
- Preparing for VoiceMeeter SDK integration.

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
1. Hardware-style volume faders with realistic metal fader caps.
2. Linkable vertical Volume and Monitor faders (0-100%) per channel.
3. Professional EQ knobs (0-10 scale): High, Mid, Low, Gain, Reverb, Delay.
4. Channel controls:
    - Lock icon (üîí/üîì)
    - Hide icon (üëÅ/üö´)
    - Color picker (8 themes)
    - 3-dot context menu (‚ãÆ) with "Rename Label" and "Select Input/Output Device" (stubbed).
5. Real-time segmented LED audio visualizers for active channels.
6. Master volume control (0-100%) and Master Monitor control (0-150%) with double-click reset.
7. Separate collapsible INPUT section and OUTPUT section.
8. Redesigned horizontal mini-channel strips display when sections are collapsed.
9. Settings dropdown menu with: Console on/off, Show/Hide channels, Auto-detect, Load/Save profiles, Add New Input/Output Channel.
10. Drag-and-drop functionality:
    - Reorder main Input/Output sections.
11. Sexy gradient borders and premium aesthetics; inter-section separator line correctly positioned.
12. Tooltip system for controls.
13. Inline channel name editing (double-click on name or via 3-dot menu).

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping.
- Final version: C# .NET (WPF or WinUI3) with VoiceMeeter SDK.
- All animations use CSS transitions/Tailwind utilities.
- Native HTML Drag and Drop API utilized for section management.

RECENT ADDITIONS / FIX ATTEMPTS:
- Removed individual channel drag-and-drop functionality. Section drag-and-drop remains.
- Refined channel context menu positioning logic.
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` on `mousedown` for VolumeFader input and EQKnob main div to prevent channel drag (though channel drag is removed, this helps isolate control interaction).
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to `handleKnobMouseDown` in App.tsx.

NEXT STEPS NEEDED (Conceptual for Demo / Actual for C# Port):
1. **Successfully resolve channel context menu positioning.**
2. **Ensure slider/knob interactions are smooth and don't trigger any unintended parent behaviors.**
3. Port to C# .NET application (WPF/WinUI3).
4. Integrate VoiceMeeter SDK (replace console.log with actual API calls, including device selection).
5. Implement Windows audio session detection (for C#).
6. Add VoiceMeeter auto-installer/detector (for C#).
7. Implement Load/Save Profile functionality (currently stubs).
8. Implement Auto-Detect Apps functionality (currently stubs).

USER PREFERENCES:
- Wants killer UX, not vanilla bullshit.
- Must look like expensive studio hardware.
- Intuitive controls that feel amazing to use.
- Dark theme with glowing effects and sexy borders.
- Hide VoiceMeeter's ugly interface completely.
- Real hardware-style fader caps.
- OCD-friendly alignment (EQ knobs perfectly vertical at center).
- Premium feel with attention to every detail.

LAST WORKING STATE: Attempting to fix context menu position and ensure fader/knob interactions are isolated. Individual channel drag-and-drop has been removed.
